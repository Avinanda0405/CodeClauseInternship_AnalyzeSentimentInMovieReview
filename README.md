We have Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and  build a sentiment analysis model. We have used few technologies like Python, Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy, etc
This project involves applying K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior and building a sentiment analysis model using NLP techniques. We'll preprocess customer data to identify patterns in purchase behavior, group similar customers, and gain insights for targeted marketing. Additionally, we'll preprocess text data (e.g., reviews or feedback), build a sentiment analysis model using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy, and evaluate its performance. This project will teach us key skills in text preprocessing, feature engineering, sentiment analysis, and clustering techniques, while using technologies like Python, Pandas, and NLP tools to process and analyze both structured and unstructured data.
